<h1>Developer Express Example<br />How to: Navigate between Views via FrameNavigationService</h1>
<p>The FrameNavigationService provides methods to navigate between Views within a NavigationFrame. This example shows how to use this service.
In this example, the MainWindow contains a NavigationFrame, which shows a HomeView at startup. The HomeView contains a Tile, which invokes a command to navigate to a DetailView when clicked. The DetailView contains the Back button for backward navigation.</p>
